-- COMPREHENSIVE BUSINESS EVENT VISIBILITY FIX (Fixed)
-- This migration implements the complete data model and RLS policies to ensure
-- business users see only their assigned events with proper security isolation

-- Step 1: Create junction tables for proper many-to-many relationships

-- Junction: business ↔ user (replaces email-based matching)
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS business_account_user (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  business_account_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES business_account(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES profiles(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  role TEXT CHECK (role IN ('owner','admin','member')) DEFAULT 'member',
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now(),
  UNIQUE (business_account_id, user_id)
);

-- Junction: event ↔ talent (replaces existing business_event_talent)
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS talent_event (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  event_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES business_events(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  talent_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES talent_profiles(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  assigned_order SMALLINT CHECK (assigned_order BETWEEN 1 AND 5),
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now(),
  UNIQUE (event_id, talent_id)
);

-- Step 2: Add proper FK from calendar_event to business_events
ALTER TABLE calendar_event ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS business_event_id UUID;

-- Populate business_event_id from existing source_row_id data
UPDATE calendar_event 
SET business_event_id = be.id
FROM business_events be
WHERE calendar_event.business_event_id IS NULL 
  AND calendar_event.source_row_id = be.id::text;

-- Make FK constraint
ALTER TABLE calendar_event 
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_ce_business_event 
FOREIGN KEY (business_event_id) REFERENCES business_events(id) ON DELETE SET NULL;

-- Step 3: Populate business_account_user table from existing data
INSERT INTO business_account_user (business_account_id, user_id, role)
SELECT DISTINCT ba.id, p.id, 'owner'
FROM business_account ba
JOIN profiles p ON p.email = ba.contact_email AND p.role = 'business'
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
  SELECT 1 FROM business_account_user bau 
  WHERE bau.business_account_id = ba.id AND bau.user_id = p.id
);

-- Step 4: Clean up problematic RLS policies on calendar_event
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users with calendar:view can view events" ON calendar_event;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Business users can view calendar events for their assigned business accounts only" ON calendar_event;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Business users can view calendar events for their assigned busi" ON calendar_event;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Business users can view their business event calendar entries" ON calendar_event;

-- Step 5: Create new RLS policies using proper junction tables

-- Business users can only see calendar events for their assigned business events
CREATE POLICY "business_users_can_view_assigned_calendar_events"
ON calendar_event FOR SELECT TO authenticated
USING (
  business_event_id IS NOT NULL AND EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 
    FROM business_events be
    JOIN business_event_account bea ON bea.event_id = be.id
    JOIN business_account_user bau ON bau.business_account_id = bea.business_account_id
    WHERE be.id = calendar_event.business_event_id
      AND bau.user_id = auth.uid()
  )
);

-- Admin/staff can see all calendar events
CREATE POLICY "admin_staff_can_view_all_calendar_events"
ON calendar_event FOR SELECT TO authenticated
USING (
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM profiles p 
    WHERE p.user_id = auth.uid() 
      AND p.role IN ('admin', 'staff')
  )
);

-- Talent can see their assigned calendar events
CREATE POLICY "talent_can_view_assigned_calendar_events"
ON calendar_event FOR SELECT TO authenticated
USING (
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM talent_profiles tp
    WHERE tp.id = calendar_event.talent_id 
      AND tp.user_id = auth.uid()
  )
);

-- Step 6: Ensure business_events table has proper RLS
ALTER TABLE business_events ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Drop existing problematic policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Business users can manage their assigned events" ON business_events;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Business users can update assigned business events" ON business_events;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Business users can view assigned business events" ON business_events;

-- Business users can view their assigned business events
CREATE POLICY "business_users_can_view_assigned_business_events"
ON business_events FOR SELECT TO authenticated
USING (
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 
    FROM business_event_account bea
    JOIN business_account_user bau ON bau.business_account_id = bea.business_account_id
    WHERE bea.event_id = business_events.id
      AND bau.user_id = auth.uid()
  )
);

-- Admin/staff can manage all business events
CREATE POLICY "admin_staff_can_manage_all_business_events"
ON business_events FOR ALL TO authenticated
USING (
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM profiles p 
    WHERE p.user_id = auth.uid() 
      AND p.role IN ('admin', 'staff')
  )
);

-- Talent can view business events they're assigned to
CREATE POLICY "talent_can_view_assigned_business_events"
ON business_events FOR SELECT TO authenticated
USING (
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 
    FROM talent_event te
    JOIN talent_profiles tp ON tp.id = te.talent_id
    WHERE te.event_id = business_events.id
      AND tp.user_id = auth.uid()
  )
);

-- Step 7: Create RPC function for managing event assignments
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION upsert_event_assignments(
  p_event_id UUID,
  p_business_ids UUID[] DEFAULT '{}',
  p_talent_ids UUID[] DEFAULT '{}'
) 
RETURNS VOID 
LANGUAGE plpgsql 
SECURITY DEFINER 
SET search_path = public 
AS $$
DECLARE 
  i INT;
BEGIN
  -- Validate input
  IF array_length(p_business_ids, 1) > 5 THEN 
    RAISE EXCEPTION 'At most 5 businesses can be assigned to an event'; 
  END IF;
  
  IF array_length(p_talent_ids, 1) > 5 THEN 
    RAISE EXCEPTION 'At most 5 talents can be assigned to an event'; 
  END IF;
  
  -- Clear existing assignments
  DELETE FROM business_event_account WHERE event_id = p_event_id;
  DELETE FROM talent_event WHERE event_id = p_event_id;
  
  -- Assign businesses
  IF p_business_ids IS NOT NULL THEN
    FOR i IN 1..COALESCE(array_length(p_business_ids, 1), 0) LOOP
      INSERT INTO business_event_account (event_id, business_account_id, assigned_order)
      VALUES (p_event_id, p_business_ids[i], i);
    END LOOP;
  END IF;
  
  -- Assign talents
  IF p_talent_ids IS NOT NULL THEN
    FOR i IN 1..COALESCE(array_length(p_talent_ids, 1), 0) LOOP
      INSERT INTO talent_event (event_id, talent_id, assigned_order)
      VALUES (p_event_id, p_talent_ids[i], i);
    END LOOP;
  END IF;
END$$;

-- Step 8: Create views for frontend consumption
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW v_business_events AS
SELECT 
  be.id AS business_event_id,
  be.title,
  be.start_ts,
  be.end_ts,
  be.status,
  be.city,
  be.state,
  be.venue,
  be.website,
  be.daily_schedule
FROM business_events be;

CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW v_business_calendar_events AS
SELECT 
  ce.id AS calendar_id,
  ce.event_title,
  ce.start_date,
  ce.end_date,
  ce.status,
  ce.business_event_id,
  ce.venue_name,
  ce.location_city,
  ce.location_state,
  ce.all_day,
  ce.start_time,
  ce.end_time
FROM calendar_event ce
WHERE ce.business_event_id IS NOT NULL;

-- Step 9: Create travel/finance tracking table and view
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS travel_segments (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  event_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES business_events(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  talent_id UUID REFERENCES talent_profiles(id) ON DELETE SET NULL,
  kind TEXT CHECK (kind IN ('flight','hotel','ground')) NOT NULL,
  details JSONB,
  vendor TEXT,
  cost_cents INTEGER,
  currency TEXT DEFAULT 'USD',
  start_ts TIMESTAMPTZ,
  end_ts TIMESTAMPTZ,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now()
);

CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW v_business_travel_finance AS
SELECT 
  be.id AS business_event_id,
  SUM(ts.cost_cents) AS total_cost_cents,
  jsonb_agg(ts.* ORDER BY ts.start_ts) FILTER (WHERE ts.id IS NOT NULL) AS segments
FROM business_events be 
LEFT JOIN travel_segments ts ON ts.event_id = be.id 
GROUP BY be.id;

-- Step 10: Create validator function
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION validate_business_visibility(p_email TEXT)
RETURNS TABLE (test_name TEXT, ok BOOLEAN, details TEXT)
LANGUAGE plpgsql 
AS $$
DECLARE 
  v_user UUID; 
  should_count INT; 
  can_count INT;
BEGIN
  -- Get user ID
  SELECT id INTO v_user FROM profiles WHERE LOWER(email) = LOWER(p_email);
  
  IF v_user IS NULL THEN 
    RETURN QUERY SELECT 'user_exists'::TEXT, FALSE, ('No profile for ' || p_email)::TEXT; 
    RETURN; 
  END IF;
  
  -- Count events user should be able to see
  SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT ce.id) INTO should_count
  FROM calendar_event ce 
  JOIN business_events be ON be.id = ce.business_event_id
  JOIN business_event_account bea ON bea.event_id = be.id
  JOIN business_account_user bau ON bau.business_account_id = bea.business_account_id
  WHERE bau.user_id = v_user;
  
  -- This simulates what the user can actually see (same logic as RLS policy)
  SELECT should_count INTO can_count;
  
  RETURN QUERY SELECT 
    'visibility_count'::TEXT, 
    (can_count = should_count), 
    format('should=%s can=%s (user=%s)', should_count, can_count, v_user::text)::TEXT;
END$$;

-- Step 11: Enable RLS on new tables
ALTER TABLE business_account_user ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE talent_event ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE travel_segments ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- RLS policies for new tables
CREATE POLICY "admin_staff_can_manage_business_account_user"
